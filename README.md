# Telecom Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using advanced ensemble learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain them. Ensemble methods such as **CatBoost**, **XGBoost**, and **LightGBM** were used to achieve high accuracy and robustness in predicting churn.

## Project Goals
- **Predict churn**: Identify customers likely to churn (leave) the telecom service.
- **Build accurate predictive models** using advanced ensemble learning techniques.
- **Improve customer retention**: By identifying churn risk, companies can take actions to retain customers.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language used for the project.
- **Ensemble Learning**:
  - **CatBoost**: A gradient boosting library known for its ability to handle categorical features without needing explicit preprocessing.
  - **XGBoost**: A highly efficient and popular gradient boosting algorithm that helps achieve high model accuracy.
  - **LightGBM**: A fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting framework specifically optimized for large datasets.
- **Data Processing and Feature Engineering**:
  - pandas, numpy
  - scikit-learn for preprocessing and model evaluation
- **Model Evaluation**: 
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
- **Data Visualization**: 
  - matplotlib, seaborn for model evaluation and feature analysis
## Ensemble Learning Models
1. **CatBoost**:
   - A gradient boosting library specifically designed to handle categorical variables directly without explicit preprocessing.
   - Model hyperparameters like `iterations`, `learning_rate`, and `depth` were tuned for optimal performance.

2. **XGBoost**:
   - Known for its speed and high performance, XGBoost is used to build a robust model to predict churn.
   - Hyperparameters such as `learning_rate`, `n_estimators`, and `max_depth` were optimized.

3. **LightGBM**:
   - A fast, distributed gradient boosting framework designed for large datasets. It uses histogram-based techniques to speed up training.
   - Hyperparameters like `num_leaves`, `learning_rate`, and `n_estimators` were tuned for improved model accuracy.
